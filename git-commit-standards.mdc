# Git Commit Standards

Git history is extremely important. Follow these rules for all commits.

## Commit Structure

- **Small, atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
- **Separate subject from body** with a blank line
- **Subject line:**
  - Maximum 50 characters
  - Capitalize first letter
  - No period at the end
  - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Body:**
  - Wrap at 72 characters
  - Explain "what and why" vs "how"
  - Use the template below

## Commit Message Template

```bash
# If applied, this commit will...

# Why is this change needed?

# How does it address the issue?

# Provide links to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources
```

## Examples

```bash
✅ GOOD
Add user authentication endpoint

Implement JWT-based authentication to secure API access.

Uses django-ninja-jwt for token generation and validation.
Access tokens expire in 15 minutes, refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies.

```bash
