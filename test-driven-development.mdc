# Test-Driven Development

All development must follow Test-Driven Development principles.

## Requirements

- **Write tests BEFORE implementation** - Tests define the expected behavior
- **Minimum 80% code coverage** - Enforced in CI/CD pipelines
- **Test all layers:**
  - Models and database logic
  - API endpoints and request/response handling
  - Business logic services
  - Utility functions
  - UI components (frontend)

## Example

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Test first
def test_create_task():
    # Test implementation
    pass

# Then implement the feature
```

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Test first
describe('TaskForm', () => {
  it('validates required fields', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

// Then implement the component
```
