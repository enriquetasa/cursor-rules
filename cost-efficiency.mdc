# Cost Efficiency

Keep operational costs as low as possible, especially during initial development.

## Requirements

- **Optimize resource usage** - Don't over-provision
- **Efficient database queries** - Reduce database load
- **Caching** - Use Redis to reduce redundant operations
- **Background tasks** - Batch operations when possible
- **Monitoring** - Track resource usage to identify waste

## Infrastructure Considerations

- **Start small** - Use minimal droplet sizes initially
- **Scale up** - Only when needed, based on actual usage
- **Database optimization** - Proper indexing, query optimization
- **CDN usage** - Use Cloudflare for static assets

## Examples

```python
# ❌ BAD - Inefficient, multiple database hits
for user in users:
    send_email(user)  # Each email is a separate task

# ✅ GOOD - Batch processing
send_bulk_emails(users)  # Single task processes all
```
